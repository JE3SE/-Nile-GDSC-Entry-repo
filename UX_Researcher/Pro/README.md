# UX Researcher: Pro Challenge

Welcome to the Pro track for UX Research! This level moves beyond individual features to understanding and designing the **entire ecosystem of a service**, whether digital or physical. You're expected to think strategically about every touchpoint and stakeholder.

## What to Focus On:
1.  **Holistic Perspective:** Mapping the end-to-end customer journey, including non-digital interactions and backend processes.
2.  **Stakeholder Empathy:** Understanding the roles and challenges of employees (front-stage and back-stage) in delivering the service.
3.  **Opportunity Identification:** Pinpointing critical moments of truth, pain points, and opportunities for innovation or improvement across the entire service.
4.  **Strategic Communication:** Presenting complex insights in a clear, visual, and actionable format for cross-functional teams.

## Key Deliverable: Comprehensive Service Blueprint
Your final output is a detailed blueprint that visualizes the entire service delivery, highlighting customer actions, front-stage interactions, back-stage processes, and support systems.
