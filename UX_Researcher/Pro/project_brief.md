# 📝 Project Brief: Design a Service Blueprint for a Hybrid Experience

## Challenge Title: Blueprinting the "Curbside Pickup" Experience at "FreshGrocer"

## 🎯 Goal
Design a comprehensive **Service Blueprint** for a fictional grocery chain, **"FreshGrocer,"** focusing specifically on their **"Curbside Pickup"** service. The goal is to identify points of friction for both customers and employees, and suggest improvements.

## 💡 The Problem
"FreshGrocer" launched curbside pickup, but customer satisfaction is inconsistent, and staff report inefficiencies. Your blueprint needs to expose the gaps between customer expectations and operational realities.

## ✨ Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **Customer Journey:** Map the customer's end-to-end journey for curbside pickup (from placing the order online to driving away with groceries).
2.  **Front-Stage Interactions:** Identify all visible interactions (digital interfaces, physical signs, staff interactions).
3.  **Back-Stage Processes:** Detail the internal processes and systems required for the service (e.g., order picking, inventory management, staff notification).
4.  **Support Processes:** Include any external systems or long-term support (e.g., payment system, customer service).
5.  **Pain Points & Opportunities:** Clearly mark at least **5 pain points** and **5 corresponding opportunities** for improvement on the blueprint.
6.  **Key Metrics/KPIs:** Suggest 2-3 metrics that could be used to measure the success of the curbside pickup service.

## 🚫 Constraints
* **Scope:** Focus *only* on the curbside pickup service.
* **Fictional Context:** All roles, processes, and interactions are hypothetical but should be realistic.
* **Visual Clarity:** The blueprint must be easy to read and understand.

## 🚀 Deliverables
1.  **Service Blueprint:** The completed blueprint using the provided `blueprint_template.fig` (or your preferred tool), exported as a **PDF**.
2.  **Brief Justification:** In your submission, highlight **three key areas of improvement** that your blueprint revealed and briefly explain why they are critical.
