# 📝 Project Brief: Design a Study & Synthesize User Interview Findings

## Challenge Title: Investigating Barriers to Collaboration in "TeamConnect"

## 🎯 Goal
Design a complete research plan and synthesize the findings (hypothetically) to understand **why users are not using the real-time collaboration features** in a fictional project management app called **"TeamConnect."**

## 💡 The Problem
"TeamConnect" offers real-time editing, but usage rates are low. Product management believes users are unaware of the feature; your task is to confirm or challenge this assumption through qualitative research.

## ✨ Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **Research Plan (Part 1):** Define the following:
    * **Study Objective:** A clear statement of what you intend to learn (e.g., "To understand the barriers that prevent users from utilizing feature X").
    * **Hypothesis:** A testable assumption (e.g., "Users don't use X because they prefer Y.").
    * **Screener Questions:** 3-5 questions to recruit appropriate participants (e.g., "How many projects do you currently manage?").
2.  **Interview Guide (Part 2):** Draft **5-7 neutral, open-ended questions** designed to probe user behavior and pain points related to project collaboration.
3.  **Synthesis (Part 3 - Hypothetical):** Based on the research question, generate **three hypothetical Key Findings** and **three corresponding Design Recommendations** (e.g., Finding: Users couldn't find the share button. Recommendation: Increase the visual prominence of the share button).

## 🚫 Constraints
* **Methodology:** The research must be a **qualitative interview study** (not a survey or usability test).
* **Focus:** The focus is on the *why*—not *how much*.

## 🚀 Deliverables
1.  **Full Research Report:** The completed report using the provided template, saved as a **PDF**. This document should contain all three required parts (Plan, Guide, Synthesis).
2.  **Brief Justification:** In your submission, explain how you ensured your interview questions were **unbiased and non-leading**.

## 🔗 Starter File
Use the structured **`research_report_template.md`** to organize your submission.
