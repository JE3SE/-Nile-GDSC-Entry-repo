# UX Researcher: Intermediate Challenge

Welcome to the Intermediate track! Your focus now shifts from simply conducting tests to **designing the study and analyzing the results**. This challenge requires a deeper understanding of qualitative research methods.

## What to Focus On:
1.  **Research Planning:** Defining clear, unbiased objectives, hypotheses, and screening criteria for participants.
2.  **Qualitative Interviewing:** Structuring questions to elicit rich, insightful narratives and 'why' behind user behavior.
3.  **Synthesis:** Moving beyond raw data to **identify key themes, pain points, and opportunities** across multiple participant interviews.
4.  **Reporting:** Presenting findings in a clear, actionable format for design and product teams.

## Key Deliverable: Actionable Research Report
Your final output must be a concise report that synthesizes your (hypothetical) findings into clear, prioritized recommendations.
