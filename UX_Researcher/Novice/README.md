# UX Researcher: Novice Challenge

Welcome to the foundation of User Experience (UX) Research! Your goal in this track is to learn how to gather meaningful data from users to inform design decisions.

## What is UX Research?
UX Research is the systematic study of target users and their needs to add realistic context and insight to the design process. It helps answer *why* people do what they do and ensures we're solving the right problems.

## Key Concepts to Explore:
1.  **Usability:** How easy and effective a product is to use.
2.  **Test Script:** A detailed document used to guide a testing session, ensuring all participants are asked the same questions and tasks.
3.  **Task-Based Testing:** Asking users to perform specific actions (tasks) to see where a design breaks down.
4.  **Neutral Questioning:** Asking open-ended questions that don't lead the user to a specific answer.

## How to Approach This Challenge:
* **Be a good listener:** Focus on what the user does and says, not what you want them to say.
* **Define clear tasks:** The user must know exactly what they need to accomplish.
* **Avoid jargon:** Use simple, everyday language in your script.

## Next Steps:
Proceed to `project_brief.md` to define the specific usability test you need to script.
