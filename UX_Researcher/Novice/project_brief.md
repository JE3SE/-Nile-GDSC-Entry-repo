# 📝 Project Brief: Scripting a Simple Usability Test

## Challenge Title: Testing the Clarity of a Mobile Sign-Up Flow

## 🎯 Goal
Your task is to create a complete, easy-to-follow **Usability Test Script** for a fictional mobile app's **sign-up process**. The goal of the test is to identify any confusing steps, unclear button labels, or points of friction in the flow.

## 💡 The Problem
The fictional app, "QuickLaunch," wants to ensure its sign-up process is intuitive. Your test script needs to guide a moderator through the session to collect actionable feedback on clarity and ease of use.

## ✨ Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **Moderator Introduction:** Include a clear introduction (3-5 sentences) that covers the test's purpose, confidentiality, and time estimate.
2.  **Pre-Test Questions:** Include **2-3 open-ended questions** to establish the participant's background and expectations (e.g., "How often do you sign up for new mobile apps?").
3.  **Core Task:** Define one primary task for the user to perform (e.g., "Please sign up for an account using your email address.").
4.  **Post-Task Questions:** Include **2-3 probing questions** to follow up after the user completes (or fails) the task (e.g., "What was the most confusing part of that process?").
5.  **Time Estimate:** Provide an estimated duration for the entire session (e.g., 15 minutes).

## 🚫 Constraints
* **No Leading Questions:** All questions must be neutral and non-judgmental.
* **Focus on Script:** You are *not* running the test or designing the UI; you are only writing the guide for the moderator.
* **Max 2 Pages:** The entire script should be concise.

## 🚀 Deliverables
1.  **Usability Test Script:** The completed script saved as a **PDF** (or DOCX/Google Doc link) based on the provided template.
2.  **Brief Justification:** In your submission, include a sentence explaining **why you chose your specific task** (e.g., "I chose the sign-up task because it's the critical first hurdle for a new user.").
