# 📝 Project Brief: Map a Simple 5-Step Task Flow

## Challenge Title: Guiding a User to "Save a Favorite Recipe"

## 🎯 Goal
Design a clear, logical, and concise **5-step task flow** for a fictional recipe app, **"FlavorFinder."** The goal is to map the path a user takes to find a recipe and save it to their favorites.

## 💡 The Problem
A user should be able to complete a core action quickly. If the steps are confusing or too numerous, the user will abandon the task. Your flow must prioritize **efficiency and clarity** in a maximum of 5 distinct actions/screens.

## ✨ Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **Starting Point:** The flow begins from the app's **Home Screen/Dashboard**.
2.  **Concise Steps:** The entire "happy path" (successful completion) must be mapped using **exactly 5 steps/screens**.
3.  **Clear Labels:** Every box in the flow must be labeled with a clear action (e.g., "Tap Search Icon") or a screen name (e.g., "Recipe Details Screen").
4.  **Flowchart Notation:** Use simple boxes (for screens) and arrows (for actions/transitions).

## 🚫 Constraints
* **Limit:** Maximum of 5 steps/screens.
* **No Visual Design:** You are *not* designing the screen visuals. Focus only on the **structure and labels**.
* **No Edge Cases:** Do not include error messages or alternative paths (e.g., logging in).

## 🚀 Deliverables
1.  **Completed Task Flow:** The final flow chart, created using the provided `flow_template.fig` (or your tool), exported as a **PDF or PNG**.
2.  **Brief Justification:** In your submission, explain how you achieved **efficiency** in your flow. Why did you choose these 5 steps and not more?
