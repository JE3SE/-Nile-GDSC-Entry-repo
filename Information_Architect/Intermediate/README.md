# Information Architect: Intermediate Challenge

Welcome to the Intermediate IA track! Your focus here shifts from mapping a single task flow to **designing the structural foundation for an entire product or major section**. This requires using research methods to ensure content organization aligns with user expectations.

## What to Focus On:
1.  **Sitemap Design:** Creating a structured, hierarchical model of an application's content (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3).
2.  **Taxonomy & Labeling:** Moving beyond single-word labels to create clear category names that accurately reflect the content underneath.
3.  **Research Application:** Using **Card Sorting** (how users group content) or **Tree Testing** (how easily users find content) data to justify structural decisions.
4.  **Navigation Systems:** Considering how your structure translates into a visible navigation system (e.g., global navigation, side menus).

## Key Deliverable: Research-Driven Sitemap
Your final output must be a visual sitemap that logically organizes content and is backed by a clear rationale based on user behavior.

## Next Steps:
Review the `project_brief.md` for the specific content challenge and the hypothetical research data you must analyze and apply.
