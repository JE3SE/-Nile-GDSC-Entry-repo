# 📝 Project Brief: Designing a Sitemap Based on Card Sorting Data

## Challenge Title: Rebuilding the Navigation for a Financial Education Hub

## 🎯 Goal
Design a clear, logical, three-level **Sitemap** for a fictional application, **"FinanceFlow,"** a learning hub where users track their spending and learn about investing. You must use the provided **hypothetical Card Sorting data** to determine the best structure.

## 💡 The Problem
The existing navigation is confusing; users can't easily find content like "Budgeting Tips" or "Retirement Calculators" because the current labels are too technical. Your task is to organize 25 core content pages into clear, user-friendly categories.

## ✨ Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **Analyze Hypothetical Data:** Assume your Card Sorting study (where 30 users grouped 25 topics) resulted in the following three clusters for the main navigation (Level 1):
    * **Group A:** Items related to long-term money goals (e.g., retirement, saving for a house, investment basics).
    * **Group B:** Items related to immediate, daily spending (e.g., budgeting, tracking receipts, avoiding debt).
    * **Group C:** Items related to the app's internal account management (e.g., profile settings, notifications, premium subscription).
2.  **Sitemap Creation:** Create a visual sitemap that goes **three levels deep** (e.g., Level 1: Main Categories; Level 2: Sub-Categories; Level 3: Individual Pages/Tools).
3.  **Labeling:** Create **new, user-friendly, non-technical labels** for the three main Level 1 categories (replacing "Group A," "Group B," "Group C") based on what the content implies.
4.  **Placement:** Clearly show how the 25 pages would be logically distributed under your new Level 2 and Level 3 sections.

## 🚫 Constraints
* **Hierarchy:** Must be exactly three levels deep.
* **Research Application:** Your Level 1 labels and structure must be directly justified by the hypothetical groupings provided.
* **No Visuals:** Focus on boxes, lines, and text labels only.

## 🚀 Deliverables
1.  **Sitemap:** The completed visual sitemap using the provided **`sitemap_template.fig`** (or your tool), exported as a **PDF or PNG**.
2.  **Brief Justification:** In your submission, write a paragraph explaining your chosen **three Level 1 labels** and how they are better than the previous, technical ones.
