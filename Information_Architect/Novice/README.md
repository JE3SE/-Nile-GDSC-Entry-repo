# Information Architect: Novice Challenge

Welcome to the world of Information Architecture (IA)! IA is all about **structure and organization**. It’s the invisible framework that makes an app or website intuitive, ensuring users can find what they need easily and know where they are at all times.

## What to Focus On:
1.  **Task Analysis:** Breaking a user's goal (e.g., "watch a movie") into discrete, necessary steps.
2.  **Flow Mapping:** Visualizing the sequence of screens or actions required to complete a goal.
3.  **Labeling Systems:** Choosing clear, unambiguous names for links, buttons, and pages.
4.  **Logical Sequencing:** Ensuring the steps follow a natural, cognitive sequence for the user.

## How to Approach This Challenge:
* **Keep it Simple:** Focus on the "happy path" (the main successful route) without worrying about errors or edge cases.
* **Use Clear Labels:** Each step/screen should have a label that tells the user exactly what it is.
* **Think Step-by-Step:** Don't skip any necessary action, even small ones like tapping a button.
