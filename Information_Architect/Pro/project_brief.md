# 📝 Project Brief: Content & Navigation Strategy for an Enterprise SaaS Platform

## Challenge Title: Designing Scalable IA for "Nexus," a Multi-Role HR Platform

## 🎯 Goal
Develop a comprehensive **Content Strategy and Adaptive Navigation Plan** for "Nexus," a fictional Enterprise SaaS (Software as a Service) platform used by companies to manage employee growth. The system must accommodate two primary user roles: **Employees** and **Managers/Admins**.

## 💡 The Problem
Nexus currently has a single, flat navigation bar, which overwhelms Employees with "Manager-only" tools (like budget approval) and makes it difficult for Managers to quickly find critical reports. The system is also expected to triple its feature set in the next 18 months.

## ✨ Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **Adaptive Sitemap:** Design a **two-tiered sitemap** (visual or textual) showing the **Level 1 and Level 2 navigation** for *both* the **Employee** role and the **Manager/Admin** role. Highlight where the navigation differs.
2.  **Taxonomy & Labeling:** Define the primary **Content Types** (e.g., "Training Modules," "Performance Reviews," "Expense Reports") and propose a consistent **naming convention** for at least 5 of them (e.g., always use "Reviews" instead of "Appraisals").
3.  **Governance Principle:** Propose **one high-level governance rule** to ensure content clarity and relevance (e.g., "All content must be owned and reviewed annually").
4.  **Navigation Logic:** Justify your choice of navigation pattern for the Manager/Admin view (e.g., "Left-hand sidebar" vs. "Top tab bar") based on their primary tasks.

## 🚫 Constraints
* **Focus on Strategy:** You are **not** designing the final UI. Focus on the *rules* and *structure*.
* **Roles:** You must clearly differentiate the navigational needs of the two specified user roles.
* **Scalability:** Your proposed Level 2 structure must be easily expandable.

## 🚀 Deliverables
1.  **Content Strategy Document:** The completed strategy using the provided **`content_strategy_doc.md`** template, saved as a **PDF or markdown file**.
2.  **Brief Justification:** In your submission, explain how your proposed structure prepares the system for **long-term growth** (i.e., how would new features fit in?).

## 🔗 Starter File
Use the structured **`content_strategy_doc.md`** template to organize your submission.
