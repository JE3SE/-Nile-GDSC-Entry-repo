# Information Architect: Pro Challenge

Welcome to the Pro IA track! Your focus here shifts to **enterprise-level strategy**—designing systems that can support millions of data points, multiple user types, and long-term scalability. You are acting as a strategic consultant, not just a map maker.

## What to Focus On:
1.  **Audience-Specific Navigation:** Designing a navigation system that dynamically adapts to different user roles (e.g., Administrator vs. Basic User).
2.  **Taxonomy & Ontology:** Defining the *relationships* between different content types and creating a controlled, scalable vocabulary (taxonomy) for the entire system.
3.  **Governance:** Proposing rules for how content is created, maintained, and retired to ensure long-term clarity.
4.  **Scalability:** Designing a structure that can easily accommodate 5-10 new major features without requiring a full redesign.

## Key Deliverable: Comprehensive Content Strategy Document
Your final output is a structured strategy document that defines the rules, vocabulary, and navigation logic for a large system.

## Next Steps:
Review the `project_brief.md` for the specific complex platform and user roles you must accommodate in your strategy.
