# ðŸŽ¨ GDSC Design Group Application Challenges Repository

This is the repository for the Nile GDSC **Design Team** application entry. Please make sure to read below before proceeding.

## Overview

This repository contains **Design Challenges** at three skill levels:

### Novice Level

Challenges designed for those **new to design**, focusing on fundamental principles, basic tool usage, and visual elements.

### Intermediate Level

Challenges designed for those with **foundational design knowledge**, requiring skills in user empathy, information architecture, and UI component design.

### Pro Level

Advanced challenges for **experienced designers**, featuring more complex projects like end-to-end case studies, full branding strategy, and high-fidelity prototyping.

All levels include challenges in these four key **Design Disciplines**:

  - **User Experience (UX)** - User research, journey mapping, and information architecture
  - **User Interface (UI)** - Visual design, typography, color theory, and high-fidelity prototyping
  - **Branding & Visual Identity** - Logo design, brand guidelines, and mood boards
  - **Design Tools & Systems** - Component libraries, auto-layout, and cross-platform adaptation

-----

## Getting Started

1.  **Choose your level**: Navigate to the `Novice/`, `Intermediate/`, or `Pro/` folder
2.  **Select a domain**: Choose from the design disciplines listed above.
3.  **Read the instructions**: Review the `README.md` and **`project_brief.md`** in your chosen folder.
4.  **Complete the challenge**: Open the **`starter_template.fig`** (or relevant file/link) and complete **ANY ONE challenge** (or 2 if you want to challenge yourself).
