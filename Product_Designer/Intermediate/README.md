# Product Designer: Intermediate Challenge

Welcome to the Intermediate Product Design track! Here, you move from **defining the problem** to **designing the solution**. Your primary goal is to translate user needs into a functional, validated experience using mid-fidelity prototypes.

## What to Focus On:
1.  **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria:** Designing a flow that rigorously satisfies the "As a user, I want..." story and meets all functional criteria.
2.  **Mid-Fidelity Prototyping:** Using clear wireframes (with real text and information hierarchy, but minimal styling) to focus on functionality and flow, not aesthetics.
3.  **Prototyping Tools:** Utilizing interactive features (links, hover effects) in your design tool to create a clickable, testable flow.
4.  **Edge Cases:** Considering secondary paths, like what happens when data is empty or an action fails.

## Key Deliverable: Interactive Mid-Fidelity Prototype
Your final output is a clickable prototype that demonstrates how a user successfully completes the entire story, ready for a simple usability test.

## Next Steps:
