# 📝 Project Brief: Design a Mid-Fidelity Prototype for a Subscription Management Feature

## Challenge Title: Prototyping the "Update Payment Method" User Story

## 🎯 Goal
Design an interactive **Mid-Fidelity Prototype** for the user story: **"As a user, I want to update my credit card information for my subscription without calling customer service, so that my service is not interrupted."**

## 💡 The Problem
A poor payment update flow often leads to involuntary churn (users leaving because their payment failed). Your prototype must be simple, secure-feeling, and provide clear feedback at every stage.

## ✨ Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **User Story Fulfillment:** The prototype must successfully guide the user from the "Settings" screen through to a final "Success" confirmation screen.
2.  **Screen Flow (4-6 Screens):** The flow must include the following logical steps:
    * **Subscription/Billing Screen (Start)**
    * **New Payment Method Form (Crucial)**
    * **Review Screen (Final Confirmation before submission)**
    * **Success/Confirmation Screen (End)**
3.  **Mid-Fidelity Design:** Use wireframes with **actual text labels** and clear information hierarchy. Do **not** use final colors, images, or detailed styling.
4.  **Interactivity:** The prototype must be fully **clickable** in your design tool (e.g., Figma) to simulate the experience.
5.  **Edge Case:** Include one screen that shows an **error message** (e.g., "Card details invalid. Please try again.") and a clear path to fix it.

## 🚫 Constraints
* **Fidelity:** Must be Mid-Fidelity (focused on structure and flow).
* **Tool:** Must be designed in an interactive prototyping tool (Figma, Sketch, etc.).
* **Simplicity:** Focus only on the credit card update; ignore adding new subscriptions or managing tiers.

## 🚀 Deliverables
1.  **Prototype Link:** The link to your interactive prototype (e.g., a shared Figma link), placed in the **`mid_fi_prototype_link.txt`** file.
2.  **Brief Justification:** In your submission, explain **one specific design choice** you made to make the user feel that the process was **secure** (e.g., a specific placement of a lock icon or a clear privacy statement).

## 🔗 Starter File
Place the public link to your prototype in the `mid_fi_prototype_link.txt` file.
