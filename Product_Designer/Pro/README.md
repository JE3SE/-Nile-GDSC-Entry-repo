# Product Designer: Pro Challenge

Welcome to the ultimate test of Product Design competency. This challenge requires you to operate at a strategic, senior level, leading a feature from its initial **problem validation** through to **developer handoff and success measurement**.

## What to Focus On:
1.  **Strategic Alignment:** Connecting your solution directly to a major business objective (e.g., increasing revenue, reducing support costs).
2.  **Full-Stack Design:** Demonstrating proficiency in **Research, Mid-Fidelity, High-Fidelity UI, and Prototyping** within a single, cohesive narrative.
3.  **Metrics:** Defining clear **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** that measure your solution's success.
4.  **Storytelling:** The final case study must be a clear, compelling narrative that justifies *every* major decision to an executive audience.
5.  **Technical Handoff:** Including specifications that would allow a developer to accurately build the feature.

## Key Deliverable: Full Product Case Study
Your final output is a professional, comprehensive case study presentation that documents your entire process.
