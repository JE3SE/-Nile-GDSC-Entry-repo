# 📝 Project Brief: Full Case Study: Designing a Solution to Reduce Churn

## Challenge Title: End-to-End Design of a Proactive "Subscription Health" Feature

## 🎯 Goal
Design and document a complete product solution for a financial planning app, **"WealthTrack,"** to **proactively prevent user churn** by increasing their confidence in their subscription value. Your feature must aim to **reduce voluntary churn by 10%**.

## 💡 The Problem
"WealthTrack" sees a high rate of voluntary churn—users canceling their subscription because they "don't see the value" or "forgot why they signed up." The current UI doesn't clearly articulate the benefits they've already received. Your task is to design a feature that increases perceived value.

## ✨ Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **Problem Validation:** Define a clear **Problem Statement** and **Hypothesis** linking value perception to churn.
2.  **The Solution:** Design a new feature, "Subscription Health," that clearly visualizes the value the user has received (e.g., "You've saved X hours of planning," "You've uncovered Y insights").
3.  **Visual Deliverables:** Include **Mid-Fidelity Wireframes** for the feature flow (3-5 screens) and the **Final High-Fidelity UI** for 2 key screens.
4.  **Handoff Documentation:** Include **one page** in your case study specifically for developers, outlining the **design tokens** (e.g., specific color names) and **component states** used in the key screens.
5.  **Metrics:** Define **one leading KPI** (e.g., Feature Usage Rate) and the **one lagging KPI** (Voluntary Churn Rate) your feature will impact.

## 🚫 Constraints
* **Scope:** Focus on designing a *proactive* feature to show value, not the *cancellation flow* itself.
* **Format:** The entire project must be summarized in the required case study template.

## 🚀 Deliverables
1.  **Product Case Study:** The completed document using the **`product_case_study_template.pdf`** structure, exported as a **PDF** (max 15 slides/pages).
2.  **Prototype Link:** Include a link to the interactive, high-fidelity prototype in the PDF.
