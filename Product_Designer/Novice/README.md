# Product Designer: Novice Challenge

Welcome to the foundation of Product Design! As a Product Designer, your job is not just to make things look good, but to **solve meaningful user problems** in ways that meet business goals. This track starts with the most critical question: **What problem are we actually trying to solve?**

## What to Focus On:
1.  **Problem Framing:** Clearly and concisely articulating a user problem using a structured format.
2.  **User Identification:** Defining *who* is experiencing the problem (the target user).
3.  **Hypothesis Generation:** Proposing a testable solution idea and defining its expected outcome (the **If/Then/Because** statement).
4.  **Business Goal Alignment:** Ensuring the problem and solution, if successful, will deliver value to the business.

## How to Approach This Challenge:
* **Start with the User:** Use the "User needs X because Y" format.
* **Be Specific:** Avoid vague statements. Use clear language about what the user can't do today.
* **Make it Testable:** Your hypothesis should be something you can prove or disprove with data (even if hypothetical).

## Key Deliverable: Defined Problem Statement
Your final output is a structured text document that clearly defines the problem and proposes a measurable hypothesis.

## Next Steps:
Review the `project_brief.md` for the specific product context and the problem area you need to define.
