# 📝 Project Brief: Defining a Feature's Problem and Hypothesis

## Challenge Title: Framing the Problem for a Community Task-Sharing Feature

## 🎯 Goal
For a fictional local community app called **"LocalLink,"** you need to clearly define a problem and propose a solution hypothesis for a new **task-sharing feature**. This feature is intended to help neighbors help each other with small chores (e.g., watering plants, walking a dog).

## 💡 The Problem
While "LocalLink" has many users, there is very low interaction outside of reading news feeds. People feel disconnected from their immediate neighbors. We need a feature that promotes genuine, helpful interaction.

## ✨ Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **User Profile:** Define a single **target user** profile for this problem (e.g., "The Busy Young Professional" or "The Elderly Homeowner").
2.  **Problem Statement:** Frame the problem using the **"User needs..."** format, focusing on the pain point.
3.  **Hypothesis Statement:** Formulate a single, concise **If/Then/Because** hypothesis for your proposed task-sharing feature.
    * **If** we design X (Solution), **then** Y (Expected Result), **because** Z (Underlying Reason/Value).
4.  **Success Metric:** Identify **one primary metric** (KPI) that would measure the success of your proposed feature (e.g., "Number of tasks completed per week").

## 🚫 Constraints
* **Format:** All answers must fit within the structured sections of the `problem_statement_template.md`.
* **Focus:** Do not design the screen itself. Focus only on the strategic text documents.

## 🚀 Deliverables
1.  **Problem Statement Document:** The completed document using the provided **`problem_statement_template.md`**, saved as a **TXT or PDF**.
2.  **Brief Justification:** In your submission, explain how your hypothesis (Part 3) directly addresses the core **pain point** defined in your problem statement (Part 2).

## 🔗 Starter File
Use the structured **`problem_statement_template.md`** to organize your submission.
