# 📝 Project Brief: Map a Simple User Journey

## Challenge Title: Guiding Users to "Check Daily Workout Progress"

## 🎯 Goal
Your task is to map out a clear and intuitive **user journey** for a fictional fitness app called **"FitPulse."** Specifically, you need to show the steps a user would take to **check their daily workout progress** after opening the app. The goal is to make this core action easily accessible and understandable.

## 💡 The Problem
Users often struggle to find key information in fitness apps if the navigation isn't clear. Your job is to define a direct path to this common task.

## ✨ Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **Starting Point:** The journey begins with the user **opening the "FitPulse" app** on their phone.
2.  **Clear Steps:** Identify and name each distinct step or screen the user encounters to reach their daily progress.
3.  **Conciseness:** The journey should be **no more than 4-5 steps** (including the start and end).
4.  **Logical Flow:** Ensure the progression of steps is natural and intuitive.

## 🚫 Constraints
* **No Visual Design:** You are *not* designing the actual screens. Focus on the labels/names of the steps and the connections between them.
* **Simple Task:** Stick to the single task of "checking daily workout progress." Do not include other features.
* **Mobile Context:** Assume the user is interacting with a mobile app.

## 🚀 Deliverables
1.  **Completed Journey Map:** Use the provided `journey_map_template.fig` (or your preferred tool) to create a simple flow chart showing the steps. Export this as a **PDF or PNG**.
2.  **Brief Justification:** In your submission, write 2-3 sentences explaining **why you chose this specific sequence of steps** and how it ensures ease of use for the user.
