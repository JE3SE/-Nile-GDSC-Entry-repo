# üìù Project Brief: Create a Color Palette & Typography Scale

## Challenge Title: Crafting the Visual Essence of "EcoGarden"

## üéØ Goal
Your task is to develop a foundational **color palette** and **typography scale** for a new fictional mobile application called **"EcoGarden."** This app helps users grow their own vegetables and manage their home gardens sustainably. The visual identity should convey **freshness, nature, growth, and simplicity.**

## ‚ú® Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **Primary Color:** Choose one main color that strongly represents the app (e.g., a shade of green for nature).
2.  **Secondary Color(s):** Select 1-2 complementary colors that support the primary color without overpowering it (e.g., an earthy brown, a sky blue, or a subtle yellow).
3.  **Accent Color:** Choose one bright, distinct color for calls-to-action (buttons, highlights) that stands out but still fits the overall theme.
4.  **Typography - Heading Font:** Select one font for main headings (e.g., app title, section headers) that reflects the app's personality.
5.  **Typography - Body Font:** Select one highly readable font for all body text (e.g., paragraph text, descriptions). This should contrast well with the heading font.
6.  **Color Documentation:** For each color, provide its **Hex Code** (e.g., `#4CAF50`).
7.  **Font Documentation:** For each font, state its **name** and a recommended **purpose** (e.g., "Open Sans - Body Text").

## üö´ Constraints
* **No Logo Design:** You are *not* designing a logo for this challenge. Focus purely on colors and fonts.
* **Simple Palette:** Limit your palette to **1 Primary, 1-2 Secondary, and 1 Accent Color** (total 3-4 distinct colors).
* **No More Than Two Fonts:** Stick to one heading font and one body font.

## üöÄ Deliverables
1.  **Visual Presentation:** Create a simple board (in Figma, Google Slides, or even a simple image editor) showcasing your chosen colors and fonts. For colors, show swatches with their hex codes. For fonts, show examples of the heading and body text. Export this as a **PDF or PNG**.
2.  **Brief Justification:** In your submission, write a short paragraph (3-5 sentences) explaining **why you chose these specific colors and fonts** to represent "EcoGarden" and how they convey freshness, nature, etc.

## üîó Starter Assets (Optional)
Explore the `starter_assets/` folder for some inspiration images and text for fonts. You are not required to use these, but they can kickstart your ideas.
