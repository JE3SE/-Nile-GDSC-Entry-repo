# 📝 Project Brief: Design a Simple Mobile Login Screen

## Challenge Title: Create an Engaging & Functional Login Screen

## 🎯 Goal
Your task is to design a clean, intuitive, and visually appealing **mobile login screen** for a fictional "Task Manager" application. The goal is to make it easy for new and returning users to access their accounts.

## 💡 The Problem
Many login screens are cluttered or confusing. We want to create an experience that feels welcoming and straightforward for our users.

## ✨ Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **App Title/Logo:** Include a simple title (e.g., "TaskFlow") or a placeholder for a logo.
2.  **Email Input Field:** A clear field for users to enter their email address.
3.  **Password Input Field:** A clear field for users to enter their password, with an option to "Show Password" (represented by an eye icon).
4.  **Login Button:** A prominent call-to-action button to submit credentials.
5.  **"Forgot Password?" Link:** A subtle link for password recovery.
6.  **"Don't have an account? Sign Up" Link:** A link to direct new users to a registration page.

## 🚫 Constraints
* **Single Screen:** Only design the login screen itself; no need to design other screens.
* **Color Palette:** Use a maximum of **three primary colors** (excluding black/white for text). Choose colors that convey trust and productivity.
* **Typography:** Use a maximum of **two distinct font families**.
* **Mobile Only:** Design specifically for a common mobile phone screen size (e.g., iPhone 13 Pro/Android equivalent).

## 🚀 Deliverables
1.  **High-Fidelity Screen Design:** Complete your design in the provided `starter_template.fig` (or your preferred tool) and export it as a **PDF or PNG**.
2.  **Brief Explanation:** In your submission, include a very short note (2-3 sentences) explaining **one key design choice** you made (e.g., "I chose this color because...", or "I placed the login button here because...").
