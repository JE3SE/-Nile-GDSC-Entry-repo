# 📝 Project Brief: Design a High-Fidelity Mobile Login Screen

## Challenge Title: Create a Trustworthy and Accessible Login UI for "CloudSync"

## 🎯 Goal
Design a clean, visually polished, and intuitive **High-Fidelity mobile login screen** for a fictional file storage app called **"CloudSync."** The design must convey a sense of **trust, security, and professionalism**.

## 💡 The Problem
A login screen is the user's first real interaction with an app's personality. If it looks unprofessional or cluttered, users may not trust the platform with their data. Your design must use clear UI patterns to build confidence.

## ✨ Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **Branding:** Choose a primary color (e.g., blue, green, or purple) that suggests security or data integrity, and use it consistently for the main Call-to-Action (CTA).
2.  **Input Fields:** Design the **Email** and **Password** fields, clearly showing the **active/focus state** of one field.
3.  **Core Actions:** Include a **Primary Login Button**, a subtle **"Forgot Password?"** link, and a link to the **"Sign Up"** page.
4.  **Security Feature:** Include a small element (like a subtle eye icon) to show the user can **reveal their password**.
5.  **Typography:** Use a heading and body text hierarchy that ensures all text is easily readable on a mobile screen.

## 🚫 Constraints
* **High-Fidelity Only:** No wireframes; the final output must look like a complete, ready-to-code screen.
* **Single Screen:** Only design the main login screen.
* **No External Assets:** You must create all elements (icons, shapes, backgrounds) yourself—do not import complex images or photos.

## 🚀 Deliverables
1.  **Mobile Screen Design:** The completed High-Fidelity screen using the provided `starter_ui_template.fig` (or your tool), exported as a **PNG or PDF**.
2.  **Brief Justification:** In your submission, explain your choice of **Primary Color** and how you used **visual hierarchy** to prioritize the "Login" button over other elements.
