# UI Designer: Novice Challenge

Welcome to the start of your UI design journey! As a UI Designer, your main goal is to make the interface **visually appealing, clear, and easy to interact with**. This challenge focuses on the most common screen in any app: the login screen.

## What to Focus On:
1.  **High-Fidelity (H-Fi) Design:** Translating an idea into a final, pixel-perfect visual state (using real colors, fonts, and icons).
2.  **Visual Hierarchy:** Using size, contrast, and spacing to guide the user's eye to the most important element (usually the primary button).
3.  **Color Application:** Using your chosen color palette effectively to differentiate active elements (buttons) from static ones (text/background).
4.  **Typography:** Selecting and sizing fonts for maximum **readability** and clear differentiation between headings, labels, and body text.

## How to Approach This Challenge:
* **Start with a Grid:** Even if you don't use a full grid system, use consistent spacing (e.g., multiples of 8px) between elements.
* **Prioritize the Action:** Ensure the Login button is the most visually dominant element on the screen.
* **Keep it Clean:** Avoid clutter. Use **whitespace** effectively to make the screen feel balanced.
