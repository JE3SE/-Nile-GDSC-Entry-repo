# UI Designer: Intermediate Challenge

Welcome to the Intermediate UI track! Your focus now expands from static screens to **interactive components** and how they behave. This is where you bring designs to life and ensure a seamless, responsive user experience.

## What to Focus On:
1.  **Component States:** Designing not just the default look, but also `hover`, `focus`, `active/pressed`, `disabled`, and `error` states for interactive elements.
2.  **Visual Feedback:** How elements visually communicate their status and responsiveness to user actions.
3.  **Consistency:** Ensuring that similar components (e.g., all buttons) behave and look consistent across all their states.
4.  **Accessibility:** Considering visual cues (e.g., focus indicators) that aid users with different needs.

## Key Deliverable: Interactive Component Collection
Your final output is a collection of a single component designed across multiple states, clearly demonstrating its full range of interactions.

## How to Approach This Challenge:
* **Think about the user's journey:** What happens visually when they click, type, or hover?
* **Use Variants (Figma):** If using Figma, leverage Variants to manage your component states efficiently.
* **Pay attention to detail:** Subtle changes in color, shadow, or border can make a huge difference in clarity.

## Next Steps:
Review the `project_brief.md` for the specific component you must design and its required states.
