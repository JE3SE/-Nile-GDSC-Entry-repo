# 📝 Project Brief: Design a Dynamic "Upload File" Button Component

## Challenge Title: Crafting Interactive States for an Upload Button

## 🎯 Goal
Design a versatile and visually clear **"Upload File" button component** for a file management application. Your design must include the **default, hover, pressed, disabled, and loading/success states** to provide rich visual feedback to the user.

## 💡 The Problem
A simple "Upload" button often doesn't communicate its status effectively. Users need to know if their click registered, if the upload is in progress, and if it was successful or failed. This interaction needs to be intuitive and reassuring.

## ✨ Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **Default State:** The standard appearance of the button, ready for interaction.
2.  **Hover State:** How the button appears when the user's cursor hovers over it (for web) or a touch target is active (mobile).
3.  **Pressed/Active State:** How the button looks when it's being clicked/tapped.
4.  **Disabled State:** How the button looks when it cannot be clicked (e.g., no file selected).
5.  **Loading State:** Show a visual indicator (e.g., spinner, progress bar) that the upload is in progress.
6.  **Success State:** A clear visual confirmation that the file has been successfully uploaded (e.g., a checkmark, green color).
7.  **Single Component:** Design only this one "Upload File" component, but show all its specified states.

## 🚫 Constraints
* **High-Fidelity:** All states must be fully designed with colors, typography, and icons.
* **Self-Contained:** The component should be designed as a standalone element, not part of a full screen.
* **Clarity:** Each state must be visually distinct and immediately understandable.

## 🚀 Deliverables
1.  **Component Design:** The complete component showing all its states, created using the provided `component_states_template.fig` (or your tool), exported as a **PDF or PNG**.
2.  **Brief Justification:** In your submission, explain **one specific visual detail** you used to make the "Loading State" clear and less anxiety-inducing for the user.
