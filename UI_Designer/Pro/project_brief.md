# 📝 Project Brief: Designing and Documenting a Dual-Mode Theme (Light/Dark)

## Challenge Title: Building a Theming System for "DataFlow" Analytics Dashboard

## 🎯 Goal
Design and document a complete **Light Mode and Dark Mode** theme for a fictional **"DataFlow" Analytics Dashboard** application. The goal is to ensure visual continuity, strong accessibility, and technical implementation readiness across both themes.

## 💡 The Problem
Implementing Dark Mode as a simple color inversion often results in poor contrast, strange-looking shadows, and a muddy feel. You must create a sophisticated theme where colors are designed for their role, ensuring the visual experience is top-tier in both settings.

## ✨ Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **Color Role Definition:** Define and document **at least 15 color tokens** using role-based names (e.g., `background-default`, `text-primary`, `accent-success`, `surface-card-subtle`).
2.  **Dual Mode Design:** Create a side-by-side demonstration of a small section of the dashboard (e.g., a header, a card, and a chart) rendered in **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode**.
3.  **Contrast Documentation:** Provide the **contrast ratio (e.g., 4.5:1)** for at least three crucial text elements in **both** themes to prove WCAG AA compliance.
4.  **Shadow & Surface:** Document how shadows (elevation) are handled in Light Mode versus Dark Mode (Hint: Shadows are usually less defined or handled with colored borders in Dark Mode).
5.  **Design Tool:** Use the provided `theme_spec_guide.fig` to organize your documentation.

## 🚫 Constraints
* **Focus on Tokens:** The bulk of the submission must be the color token definitions, not just the final screens.
* **Complex UI:** The challenge requires handling backgrounds, text, CTAs, and at least one complex data visualization element (like a simple bar chart).

## 🚀 Deliverables
1.  **Theme Specification Guide:** The completed guide using the provided **`theme_spec_guide.fig`** (or your tool), exported as a **PDF**.
2.  **Brief Justification:** In your submission, explain your strategy for designing **shadows/elevation** in Dark Mode, and why simple color inversion doesn't work.
