# UI Designer: Pro Challenge

Welcome to the Pro UI track! This level requires mastery over complex visual systems, scalability, and technical documentation. You are expected to design a complete UI experience that is adaptable, accessible, and ready for development.

## What to Focus On:
1.  **Systematic Theming:** Creating a robust, tokenized color system that easily swaps between themes (Light/Dark) without breaking visual hierarchy or accessibility.
2.  **Color Roles:** Assigning specific roles to colors (e.g., `primary-default`, `surface-subtle`, `text-inverse`) rather than using fixed hex codes.
3.  **Accessibility (A11Y):** Ensuring that color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards in *both* Light and Dark modes.
4.  **Edge Cases:** Handling complex elements like charts, shadows, and subtle backgrounds within the new theme.

## Key Deliverable: Comprehensive Theme Specification
Your final output is a detailed specification guide that developers and other designers can use to implement the dual-mode theme.

## Next Steps:
Review the `project_brief.md` for the specific components and color tokens you must define and document.
