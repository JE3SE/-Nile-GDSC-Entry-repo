# User Experience (UX): Intermediate Challenge

Welcome to the Intermediate UX track! Your focus here shifts from single actions to **entire user journeys** and the underlying structure (Information Architecture) that makes products usable.

## What to Focus On:
1.  **User Flow Optimization:** Designing the most efficient and logical path for users to complete a complex task (e.g., checkout, booking, or multi-step configuration).
2.  **Mid-Fidelity Wireframing:** Moving past basic boxes to design detailed screen layouts, hierarchy, and navigation without focusing on color or final styling.
3.  **Information Architecture (IA):** Organizing content (labels, navigation, fields) in a clear, sensible way that matches user expectations.
4.  **Edge Cases:** Considering what happens when things go wrong (e.g., an error message, an empty state).

## Key Deliverable: Mid-Fidelity Wireframes
The key to this level is demonstrating *structure and logic*. Your wireframes should clearly define the components and flow needed for the user to succeed.
