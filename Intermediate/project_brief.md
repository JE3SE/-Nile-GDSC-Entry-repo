# üìù Project Brief: Design a Mobile Service Booking Flow

## Challenge Title: Optimizing the "Book a Virtual Consultation" User Flow

## üéØ Goal
Design a complete, efficient, and low-friction mobile user flow for a fictional app called **"HealNow,"** which allows users to book a virtual consultation with a healthcare specialist. The flow must support all necessary steps from selection to confirmation.

## üí° The Problem
Online booking systems often have confusing steps, hidden fees, or unclear options. Your task is to design a flow that is **transparent, easy to navigate, and clearly communicates time and cost** at every step.

## ‚ú® Core Requirements (Must-Haves)
1.  **Clear Start:** The flow starts from a "Book a Consultation" button on a dashboard.
2.  **Necessary Steps (5-6):** The flow must include the following distinct steps/screens:
    * **Specialist/Service Selection**
    * **Date & Time Picker**
    * **Input Patient Details** (briefly, e.g., symptoms or reason for visit)
    * **Review & Payment Summary** (show total cost clearly)
    * **Confirmation Screen**
3.  **Mid-Fidelity Wireframes:** Use clear text labels, defined boxes for images/components, and grey/black colors. **No final styling or color.**
4.  **Error Handling:** Include one screen that shows an **error or empty state** (e.g., "No available appointments for this date").

## üö´ Constraints
* **Focus on Logic:** The primary focus is the *sequence* of steps and *what* information is on each screen.
* **Mobile Only:** Design for a standard mobile screen size.

## üöÄ Deliverables
1.  **Mid-Fidelity Wireframes:** Complete the flow using the provided `wireframe_template.fig` (or your preferred tool) and export the **5-6 connected screens as a PDF**.
2.  **Flowchart/Journey Map:** Include a simple visual flow showing the screens and the arrows connecting them.
3.  **Brief Justification:** Explain your reasoning for the **sequence of the steps** (e.g., "I placed the payment summary before confirmation to allow final review.").
